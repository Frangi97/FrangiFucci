		\section{Purpose}
			The purpose of this document consists of giving more technical details than the RASD concerning the SafeStreets
			system.\\
			The RASD document completely describes the system in terms of functional and nonfunctional requirements and
			serves as a contractual basis between the customer and the developer and it must be written in the language of
			the customer's domain of business/expertise, the DD's purpose instead is to provide a description for how the new
			system will be constructed, it provides a description of the system architecture, software, hardware, database
			design, and security.\\
			In particular this document will explain the following topics:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item High level architecture and its components' requirements;
				\item Run-time behavior;
				\item Design patterns;
				\item Additional user interfaces information;
				\item Implementation, integration and testing plan.
			\end{itemize}
		\section{Scope}
			Safestreet is an application to be used both from civilians (users) and authorities, in order to help the latter and
			reduce traffic violations. Registered authorities can automatically receive reports made by users, so the service acts
			as an intermediary. The next paragraph gives a more formal description of which is the purpose of the application.

		\section{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
			\subsection{Definitions}
				\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{User}: a civilian customer that can use the application to:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item notify authorities of some violation;
					\item check which are the most dangerous (i.e. with the most violations) streets.
					\end{itemize}
				In this document, ``user", ``citizen" and ``civiian" are completely equivalent, where not specified.
				\item \textbf{Authority}: a member of the local police who has access to reports made by users. The
					authorities evaluate the reports sent by the user to determine if the violation stands.
				\item \textbf{Report}: a message consisting of:
					\begin{itemize}
					\item a picture showing the car in order to show the occurring violation;
					\item date and time of the picture;
					\item GPS position of the place where the violation occurred;
					\item the street where the violation occurred (automatically retrieved from the geographical position);
					\item the type of the violation (input by the user)
					\end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Available}: a report is available for an authority if its position is within the municipality assigned
					to the authority.
				\item \textbf{Violation}: a situation that, according to the user who sent the report, is a violation of the
					traffic laws.
				\item \textbf{Intervention}: a brief text suggesting a possible solution in order to improve safety and
					discourage future violations.
				\end{itemize}
			\subsection{Acronyms}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Specification document:} "Mandatory project assignment AY 2019/20".
			\end{itemize}
		\section{Document Structure}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Chapter 1}: brief explanation on the DD purpose and a quick introduction to SafeStreets.
				\item \textbf{Chapter 2}: aims to provide a description of the system's architecture. 
				\item \textbf{Chapter 3}: specifies the design of user interfaces and describes the user-application
					interaction.
				\item \textbf{Chapter 4}: contains requirements traceability.
				\item \textbf{Chapter 5}: describes the implementation plan.
				\item \textbf{Chapter 6}: shows the effort of each group member.
				\item \textbf{Chapter 7}: it contains all the references used to make this document.
